# FTG I
This repo contains the first faster than gruz (polish for rubble) game that I am uploading here as a joke.
This gem has been created by me, probably 9 years ago, when I have first heard of programming. It has ~300 lines of global variables, cli graphics defined in-code and ~3KLOC that I am ashamed to even look at.

# If you are a recruiter, PLEASE do NOT look at this code.
There is plenty more to judge me on this repository, and this code does *NOT* represent my current programming skills.

# The game
*you have allready lost*   
In this game the objective is to go through the map with your party. There are fights with local police, black market, research system and many more. You need to keep in mind that controls are written without any user experience design in mind (I have written this game in a bus for a gods sake) so some code-digging to find an accept button WILL be nescessary.

This game is designed to run in a terminal, if for some reason it decides to spew garbage, try resizing the window and run `clean` before launching this utter sewage again.
